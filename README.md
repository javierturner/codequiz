##Installation

There is no installation required for this project.


##Usage

The purpose of this was to demonstrate my understanding of local storage along with other JavaScript fundamentals, such as methods to select elements (getElementById, querySelector, etc.), adding event listeners, setting functions to move through arrays within an object. 


##Functionality
This website functions by giving the user a dialog box explaining the rules to the quiz. Once they click "Start," they will be given 75 seconds to answer 5 questions. If they choose the wrong answer, they will be penalized by losing 5 points/seconds; if they choose the right answer, they will be awarded 10 points/seconds. Once the quiz is complete or they run out of time, they are then prompted to enter their name, which is then stored into local storage along with their score. 

There is also a button for viewing high scores, which will take them directly to the high scores page.
